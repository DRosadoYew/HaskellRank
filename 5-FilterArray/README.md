# Filter Array

### Problem statement
Filter a given array of integers and leave only that values which are less than a specified value X. The integers in the output should be in the same sequence as they were in the input. You need to write a function with the recommended method signature for the languages mentioned below. For rest of language you have to write complete code.

### Input Format:

The first line contains the delimiter *X*. This is followed by a list of integers, which represents the elements of list/array. You have to read input to the *End-Of-File*.

### Output Format:

Print integers in separate line from the array which are less than an upper-limit *X* in value. The sequence should be same as it was in the original array.

### Constraints:

*1 <= size of array <= 100*
For any element in the array, say *Y, -100 <= Y <= 100*
*-100 <= X <= 100*

### Note 
You have to write your own implementation of *filter* function. It is recommended to not use inbuilt library function.

### Sample Input:

```3
10
9
8
2
7
5
1
3
0
```

### Sample Output:

    2
    1
    0

### Method Signature:

    Number Of Parameters: 2
    Parameters: [upper-limit(X) list]
    Returns: List or Vector
