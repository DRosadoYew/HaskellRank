# Filter positions in a list

### Problem statement
For a given list with *N* integers, return a new list removing the elements at odd indices. The input and output portions will be handled automatically. You need to write a function with the recommended method signature.


### Input Format:

*N* integers contained in the list, each on a new line.

### Output Format:

List of integers, with integers at odd positions removed. The relative positions should be same as they were in the original array. Each integer will be on a new line.

**Please note, that by "odd positions" we mean the first, third, fifth position of the array need to be filtered out. As per programming language conventions, these might correspond to indices 0, 2, 4 and so on.**

### Sample Input:

```
2
5
3
4
6
7
9
8
```

### Sample Output:

```
5
4
7
8
```

### Method Signature:

```
Number Of Parameters: 1
Parameters: [list]
Returns: List or Vector
```
