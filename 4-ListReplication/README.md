# List Replication

### Problem statement
Given a list repeat each element of the list n times. The input and output portions will be handled automatically by the grader. You need to write a function with the recommended method signature.


### Input Format:

First line has integer *S* where *S* is the number of times you need to repeat elements. After this there are *X* lines, each containing an integer. These are the *X* elements of the array.

### Output Format:

Repeat each element of the original list *S* times. So you have to return list/vector/array of *S***X* integers. The relative positions of the values should be same as the original list provided as input.

### Constraints:

*0<=X<=10*
*1<=S<=100*

### Sample Input:

    3
    1
    2
    3
    4

### Sample Output:

    1

### Method Signature:

    Number Of Parameters: 2
    Parameters: [number of times to replicate elements, list]
    Returns: List or Vector
