### Problem statement
Update the values of a list with their absolute values. The input and output portions will be handled automatically during grading. You only need to write a function with the recommended method signature.

### Input Format
There are N integers, each on a new line. These are the N elements of the input array.

### Output Format
N integers each on a new line; these are the absolute values of the input list, in that order.

### Sample Input:

```
2
-4
3
-1
23
-4
-54
```


### Sample Output:

```
2
4
3
1
23
4
54
```

### Constraints
The list will have no more than 100 integers. The list will be composed of integers X such that -100 <= X <= 100.

### Method Signature:

```
Number Of Parameters: 1
Parameters: [list]
